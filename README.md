# Breast_cancer_prediction
Project Overview
This project compares three machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest — on the task of predicting breast cancer. The models are evaluated using key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and ROC curve to determine which performs best.

Usage
Load the dataset
Train the three models on the training data
Predict on the test data
Calculate evaluation metrics for each model
Visualize and compare the model performances using tables and graphs

Results Summary
Logistic Regression and Random Forest showed the highest accuracy and precision (~96%)
Decision Tree had slightly lower precision (~87%) but similar recall (~93%)
Overall, Logistic Regression and Random Forest are better choices for this dataset

Future Improvements
Include feature selection to improve model performance
Experiment with additional models like SVM and XGBoost
Deploy the best model using a web app framework like Streamlit
